          Introduction 
        </header>
        <p>Whether you use DaVinci Resolve on a
      Mac, Windows, or Linux computer, this
      training guide will teach you how to take a
      project from its initial setup to final output.
      You’ll become familiar with the standard
      menus and buttons, as well as essential
      editing, effects, color correction, and audio
      sweetening workflows.
      These first two lessons are an introduction
      to the revolutionary new cut page, which is
      designed for speed so you can edit
      projects fast. You can import media, edit,
      trim, add transitions, titles, mix audio, and
      output your programs all from within the cut
      page itself. You don’t even have to use the
      rest of DaVinci Resolve’s features if you
      don’t need to! The remaining lessons in this book will go into detail on the media, edit, fusion, color,
      fairlight and deliver pages.
      Let’s get started!</p>
      </section>
        
      <section class="main-section" id="Starting_in_the_cut_page">

          Starting in the cut page
      </header>
         <p>
           When it comes to editing, there isn’t a one size fits all approach. That’s why DaVinci
           Resolve 16 has two different editing interfaces, the cut page, and the edit page.
        </p> 
        <p>
        The new cut page is for fast turn around jobs that need to get edited and published quickly. It’s
      perfect for editing news, video blogs, online promos, educational content, and more. The
      traditional edit page features a wider range of features and works more traditionally.
        </p>
        <p> 
       You
      can choose either page, depending on what feels the most suited to your needs.In designing the cut page, Blackmagic Design took a step back and put a lot of thought into
      how to innovate and make editing faster. The cut page and the edit page provide different
      interfaces for these two very different cultures of editors. The cut page removes wasteful
      steps and anything that could slow you down. Every click or action you do on the cut page
      has a direct result.
        </p> There are no wasted clicks or optional settings to configure. The page
      works hard at anticipating what you want to do and helps you get there faster. Let’s start
      exploring the cut page by opening DaVinci Resolve and importing clips.</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>First start by launching the DaVinci Resolve application.</li>
          <li>Double-click the Untitled thumbnail to open a new project.DaVinci Resolve will open and display the page last used.</li>
          <li>At the bottom of the window, click the cut button to switch to the cut page, if necessary</li>
          <li>In the upper left corner of the media pool, click the import media folder button. </li>
          <li>In the dialog that appears, navigate to the Documents folder, where you placed the
      R16 Intro lessons folder.</li>
          <li>Within that folder, select the Lesson 01 folder, then the Quick to Cook folder and
      click open.</li>
          <li>Click Change to have the settings in DaVinci Resolve match the size and frame rate of
      the incoming clips</li>
          <li>Double click the Quick to Cook bin.
      Bins, like folders, can be used to organize your clips into categories. You can create
      multiple bins and have them all accessible without any wasted space.</li>
          <li>Click the sort drop down menu and choose timecode.</li>
           <li>
             Choose File > Save project and name the project Cooking Show.
      We’ll use the clips from this bin to quickly put together a story.
      The project you create in the next two lessons is designed to give you a tour of the cut
      page. You’ll learn all the essentials of the cut page and how quickly you can edit, enhance,
      and share a project.

          Adding clips to a timeline
      </header>
        <p>Once you have media in a bin, you can start reviewing the clips to select the ones you want
      to use in the story you are creating. You can play clips in the larger viewer by double
      clicking them in the media pool.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Double click the first clip titled master 01.</p>
            <p>The viewer now shows the clip with the audio waveform under it. You can play a clip by
      pressing the spacebar.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Press the spacebar to play the clip in the viewer</p>
            <p>This is the main take in this cooking show. Since our host doesn’t start speaking
      immediately, we can cut off the beginning of this clip before we add it to the timeline. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>At the bottom of the viewer, drag the white in point handle so it is just before the host
      begins to speak.</p>
            <p>As you drag, the audio waveform zooms in automatically, making it easier to position
      the in point just before the host speaks.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>With the in point set, drag the master 01 clip from the media pool down into the lower
      timeline window</p>
            <p>Adding a clip to an empty timeline window creates a new timeline and saves it into the
      master bin. All timelines created in the cut page are saved into the master bin, making
      them very easy to locate</p>
            <p>The trimmed clip becomes the first clip of your story. The viewer switches automatically
      to show you the clip in the timeline.</p>
            <p>The timeline is a bit different from what you may be familiar with because there are
      actually two timelines. The upper timeline shows the entire length of your story. Having
      the entire timeline always visible makes it incredibly easy to move around, no matter
      how long the timeline gets.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In the upper timeline, click in the right end of the time ruler to move the red play head
      to the end of the edit.</p>
            <p>The red play head shows the location in the timeline for the frame displayed in the
      viewer. Moving the play head updates the frame in the viewer to match.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Drag the play head in the upper timeline, back to the left end until you are at the
      beginning of the edit.</p>
            <p>The lower timeline shows a more zoomed in, detailed view of the current position. In
      the lower timeline, the play head always remains in the center while the timeline scrolls
      under it.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Press the spacebar to play the timeline until you hear the chef on the right say “prawn
      and basil spaghettini” (about 1/3rd of the way through the clip).</p>
            <p>Since this is meant to be a short promotional video that you will share on the web, the
      part we just played is a good introduction for our story. Now, you can split this clip into
      two sections by adding a cut just after the chef says’ “spaghettini”. You can refine the
      play head position by scrubbing in the lower timeline time ruler.</p>
          </li>
          <li>In the lower timeline, drag the time ruler right and left until the play head is just after the
      chef on the right says “spaghettini”.</li>
          <li>
            <p>On the left side of the toolbar, click the split button to cut the clip at the play head position.
      </p>
            <p>Splitting a clip in two using the split button creates what is called a through edit. This
      added cut or through edit in the timeline allows us to keep the first part of the clip and
      delete the unwanted part. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Select the section of the clip to the right of the play head and press the delete (macOS)
      or Backspace (Windows) key to remove that part of the clip.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>We have a great opening clip to promote this show. The next steps will be to find the parts
      from other clips that we may be interested in using.</p>

        <header>
          Reviewing clips using source tape
        </header>
         <p>Rather than double clicking each clip and playing them one by one in the viewer, you can
      find specific clips faster using the source tape feature. </p>
        <p>Back when editing was done using videotape, finding and reviewing content was easy
      because you could just shuttle up and down the tape to find the right area. Shuttling up
      and down a tape also provided the critical benefit of familiarizing you with the content. The
      source tape in the cut page brings back that old concept and completely modernizes it to
      help you find the shots that you need fast.</p>
        <p>Let’s quickly review some of our cooking shots using the source tape, so we know what we
      can use in our story.</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Using the red play head under the viewer, drag through the entire source tape to view
      all the clips in the bin.</p>
            <p>As you drag through the source tape, the current clip is highlighted in the bin as well.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Drag back to the beginning of the source tape’s string of clips.</p>
            <p>To really review all the clips we are working with, you need to play through them and
      not just skip over them by dragging. The quickest way to review clips is to use the fast
      review feature.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Click the fast review button to play quickly through all the clips in the source tape string
      of clips.</p>
           
          </li>
           <p>The fast review button plays through the clips at faster speeds for longer clips. When you
      reach one of the shorter clips, fast review will automatically slow down playback a bit so
      you don’t miss shorter clips. This gives you a quick and easy way to review new material
      which is important if you’re editing unfamiliar clips that someone else has shot. Once you
      review the content, you should have a good idea of a few shots you might like to use as
      you start to assemble your edit in the timeline.</p>
          
        </ol>
      </section>
        
      <section class="main-section" id="Appending_clips_to_the_timeline">
        <header>
          Appending clips to the timeline
        </header>
       <p>Once you have reviewed your content, you can start assembling the rest of the clips into
      your timeline. Instead of dragging, you can easily append clips one after another to the end
      of your timeline, building your story as you go. Since we have a good opening, let’s look for
      a good ending to our promo.</p>
       <ol>
         <li>While in the source tape, drag the play head to the last clip where the women pick up
      the finished plate and prepare to eat from it.</li>
         <li>Press I to mark an in point and then press O to set an out point after the host says
      “Make sure you join us next time”.
      To add this clip to the end of the timeline, you can use the append button. The append
      button always adds the marked clip to the very end of your timeline, regardless of
      where your timeline play head is located.</li>
         <li>In the toolbar, click the append button to add the selected region to the end of the
      timeline.</li>
         <li>Normally, you would keep working down the source tape, adding clips into the timeline
      as you go. In this case, let’s check our edit by dragging the play head before the new
      clip you added to the end, then press the spacebar to review the edit.</li>
       </ol>
        <p>The append edit is one of the easiest editing types since it just adds the current source clip
      to the end of your timeline. It doesn’t matter where your timeline play head is located or if
      there is an in point. Using the other edit buttons will give you additional options on where
      edits are placed.</p>
       <p>Remember the advantage of the source tape is you can keep throwing clips into the timeline
      as you go and quickly build complex edits. The viewer will stay on the source tape so you
      don’t waste mouse clicks selecting clips after each edit.</p>
